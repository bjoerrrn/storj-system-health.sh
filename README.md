# storj-system-health.sh

## about this shell script
this linux shell script checks, if a [storj node][storagenode] ([:storage node] from the [storj][storj] project) runs into errors and alerts the operator by discord push messages as well as emails. requires at least one [storj node][storagenode] running with [docker][docker] on linux.

## features
* multinode support üåç
* optionally discord (as quick notifications) and/or mail (with error details) alerts üì• üîî
* alerts:
  * when audit, suspension and/or online scores are below a threshold (storj node discqualification risk) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * alerts if audit timeouts are recognized (pending audits; discqualification risk) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * alerts in case a threshold of repair gets/puts and downloads/uploads are reached (storj node discqualification risk) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * alerts if there was no get/put at all in the last hour (storj node discqualification risk) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * alerts in case any other fatal error occurs, incl. issues with docker stability ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * alerts in case storj node version is outdated ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * alerts in case the node is offline (docker container not started) ‚ö†Ô∏è
* reports:
  * disk usage
  * success rates audits, downloads, uploads, repair up-/downloads
* optimized for crontab and command line usage üíª
* only requires [curl][curl], [jq][jq] and (optionally) [swaks][swaks] to run üî• 

## optimzed / tested for
- debian bullseye üêß
- macos monterey üçé (jq + swaks installed with brew)

## dependencies
- [storj node][storagenode] node up and running, within a 
- [docker][docker] container
- [curl][curl] (http requests)
- [jq][jq] 1.6 ‚ö†Ô∏è (JSON parsing)
- [swaks][swaks] (mail sending, smtp)
- [discord.sh][discord.sh] (discord pushes)

## setting up storj system health
1. optional: [setup a webhook][webhook] in the desired discord text channel
2. optional: grab your smtp email authentication data
3. download (or clone) a copy of `discord.sh` *
4. download (or clone) a copy of `storj-system-health.sh` and `storj-system-health.credo` **
5. optional: setup discord and mail variables in `storj-system-health.credo`
6. Go nuts üöÄ

\* `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaoticWeg/discord.sh/master/discord.sh` <br/>
\*\* `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusselmann/storj-system-health.sh/main/storj-system-health.sh && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusselmann/storj-system-health.sh/main/storj-system-health.credo`

## setting up variables in *.credo
you will need to modify these variables in `*.credo` for your specific node and smtp mail server configuration. the `*.credo` file must not include comments and blank lines, the following description is just for your explanation:
```
## discord settings
DISCORDON=true.         # enables (true) or disables (false) discord pushes
DISCORDURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
                        # your discord webhook url

## mail settings
MAILON=true             # enables (true) or disables (false) email messages
MAILFROM=""             # your "from:" mail address
MAILTO=""               # your "to:" mail address
MAILSERVER=""           # your smtp server address
MAILUSER=""             # your user name from smtp server
MAILPASS=""             # your password from smtp server

## node data mount points
MOUNTPOINTS=/mnt/node   # your storage node mount point, multiple: separated with comma
                        # e.g. /mnt/node,/mnt/node-a,/mnt/node-b
                        # enter 'source' from the docker run command here

## storj node docker names
NODES=storagenode       # storage node names, multiple: separated with comma, 
                        # e.g. storagenode,storagenode-a,storagenode-b
NODEURLS=localhost:14002
                        # storage node dashboard urls, multiple: separated with comma, 
                        # e.g. localhost:14002,192.168.171.5:14002

## alerting settings
SATPINGFREQ=3600        # in case satellite scores are below threshold, 
                        # value in seconds, when next alert will be sent earliest
```

make sure, your script is executable by running the following command. add 'sudo' at the beginning, if admin privileges are required. 
```
chmod u+x storj-system-health.sh  # or:
sudo chmod u+x storj-system-health.sh

chmod u+x discord.sh  # or:
sudo chmod u+x discord.sh
```

## usage

you can run the script in debug mode to force a push message to your discord channel (if enabled) although no error was found - or without the debug flag to run it in silent mode via crontab (see automation chapter).

```
./storj-system-health.sh -d   # for a regular discord push message or:
./storj-system-health.sh      # for silent mode
```

optionally you can pass another path to `*.credo`, in case it has another name or source:

```
./storj-system-health.sh -c /home/pi/anothername.credo
```

it also supports a help command for further details:

```
./storj-system-health.sh -h
```

## automation with crontab
to let the health check run automatically, here‚Äôs a crontab example for linux, which runs the script each hour.
```
0  *    * * *   pi      /home/pi/storj-checks.sh -d  > /dev/null
```

for macos please be aware of the following specifics:
* use `crontab -e` and `crontab -l`, although it is depricated (for now it works)
* you do not have to use the user name, it's run with the current user
* use full paths to your script and credo file
* find out your standard path with `echo ¬ßPATH` and set it in crontab
```
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
40    *  *  *  * /Users/me/storj-checks.sh -d -c /Users/me/my.credo >> /Users/me/err.txt 2>&1
```

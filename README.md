# storj-system-health.sh

## about this shell script
this linux shell script checks, if a storage node (from the [storj][storj] project) runs into errors and alerts the operator by discord push messages as well as emails. 

**features:**
* multinode support üåç
* optionally discord (as quick notifications) and/or mail (with error details) alerts üì• üîî
* alerts in case a threshold of repair gets/puts and downloads/uploads are reached (storj node discqualification risk) ‚ö†Ô∏è
* alerts if there was no get/put at all in the last hour (storj node discqualification risk) ‚ö†Ô∏è
* alerts in case the node is offline (docker container not started) ‚ö†Ô∏è
* optimized for crontab and command line usage üíª
* only requires [curl][curl], [jq][jq] and [swaks][swaks] to run üî•

## example screenshots

a message saying, that there are fatal errors

## dependencies
- [curl][curl] (http requests)
- [jq][jq] (JSON parsing)
- [swaks][swaks] (mail sending, smtp)
- [discord.sh][discord.sh] (discord pushes)

## setting up storj system health
1. optional: [setup a webhook][webhook] in the desired discord text channel
2. optional: grab your smtp email authentication data
3. download (or clone) a copy of `discord.sh`
4. download (or clone) a copy of `storj-system-health.sh` and `storj-system-health.credo` (coming soon)
5. setup discord and mail variables - or `storj-system-health.credo` (coming soon)
6. Go nuts.

## setting up variables
you will need to modify these variables for your specific node and smtp mail server configuration. here's an example to support you entering the right data:
```
## discord settings
DISCORDON=true			# enables (true) or disables (false) discord pushes
URL='https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...' 
				# your discord webhook url

## mail settings
MAILON=true			# enables (true) or disables (false) email messages
MAILFROM=""                     # your "from:" mail address
MAILTO=""                       # your "to:" mail address
MAILSERVER=""                   # your smtp server address
MAILUSER=""                     # your user name from smtp server
MAILPASS=""                     # your password from smtp server

## node data mount point
MOUNTPOINT="/mnt/node"          # your storage node mount point

## storj node docker names
## in case multinodes are used, just add them es separate strings
NODES=(
	"storagenode"
	#"storagenode-2"
	#"storagenode-3"
)
```

make sure, your script is executable by running the following command. add 'sudo' at the beginning, if admin privileges are required. 
```
chmod u+x storj-system-health.sh  # or:
sudo chmod u+x storj-system-health.sh

chmod u+x discord.sh  # or:
sudo chmod u+x discord.sh
```

## usage

you can run the script in debug mode to force a push message to your discord channel (if enabled) although no error was found - or without the debug flag to run it in silent mode via crontab (see automation chapter).

```
./storj-system-health.sh debug # for a regular discord push message or:
./storj-system-health.sh # for silent mode
```

it also supports a help command, although it currently makes no sense ;-) 

```
./storj-system-health.sh --help
```

## automation with crontab
to let the health check run automatically, here‚Äôs a crontab example, which runs the script each hour: 
```
0  *    * * *   pi      /home/pi/storj-checks.sh
```
